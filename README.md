### **Overview**

Data, codes, outputs of the analyses, and example videos from [Nest relief in the cryptically incubating semipalmated sandpiper is quick, but vocal]()

### **Folders and files**

[Data](Data/): all data used in the analyses
- column_definitions.docs - column definitions for each dataset
- observations.csv - information on each screened nest relief observation
- time_series.csv - information about when the incubating parent called or left the nest during before nest relief and control (regular incubation) observations
- nests.csv - information on nests, their position, inucbation start, end state and datetime
- birds.csv - information on the sex of each bird at each nest
- exclusions.csv - informaton on whater an observation was excluded and if so why


[R](R/): all r-scripts used in the analyses
- Constants_packages_PrepareData.R loads functions and packages used in the other R-scripts and prepares the main datasets  (needs to be always loaded before running the other scripts)
- methods-Information.R generates written outputs (e.g sample sizes, estimates) for the Methods part of the paper
- results-Behaviour_prior_to_exchange.R generates written outputs (e.g sample sizes, estimates), Tables and Figures for the 1st part of the Results - Behavior of the Incubating Parent Before the Return of Its Partner
- results-Exchange_procedure-Timing.R generates written outputs (e.g sample sizes, estimates), Tables and Figures for the 2nd part of the Results - Nest Relief Behavior: Timing
- rresults-Exchange_procedure-Vocalization.R generates written outputs (e.g sample sizes, estimates), Tables and Figures for the 3rd part of the Results - Nest Relief Behavior: Vocalizations
- sessionInfo.txt - contains information on the R-packages, operating system, and it settings used in the analyses

[Tables](Tables/): contains appendix Tables generated by the above R-scripts 

[plots](plots/): contains Figures generated by the above R-scripts and their versions modified in Adobe Illustrator, as well as plots of model assumptions

[videos_examples_youtube](videos_examples_youtube/): contains example videos of the scored behaviors, [see also online on YouTube](https://bit.ly/38vBOhC)
